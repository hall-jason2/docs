### How can I obtain a Standard Hash?

### Can a deactivated Hashes NFT be reactivated to a DAO NFT?

### What are permutations in the Hashes DAO?
Permutations in the Hashes DAO are discrete and directed initiatives that the community funds and works together to undertake.

The sponsor acts as the project manager for the permutation and is empowered to make permutation-specific executive decisions on behalf of the DAO.
