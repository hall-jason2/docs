# Permutations

Permutations in the Hashes DAO are are discrete and directed initiatives that the community funds and works together to undertake. Permutations can include things like artist or developer grants, where the DAO allocates funds to support specific projects or individuals. Alternatively, a permutation may be focused on building generative art infrastructure, which can entail both on and off-chain functionality. All permutations are proposed and voted on by the members of the DAO, and they should align with the overall ethos and mission of the collective.

During the proposal process of a permuation, a sponsor (typically the initial proposer) is elected to ensure the successful operation and fulfillment of the permuation. The sponsor acts as the project manager for the permutation, and is empowered to make permutation-specific executive decisions on behalf of the DAO. In this way, the sponsor can resolve routine challenges and decisions without requiring active participation by a quorum of DAO members. For instance, a sponsor is empowered to delegate, monitor, and remunerate constributors to a permutation. Sponsors are typically remunerated for their leadership role in the permutation also. 

Thus far, six permutations have been initiated by the Hashes DAO, and they are as follows:

### 1. The Harvest

##### Sponsor: [Meltem Demirors](https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem) (degenprincess)

In the first permutation the DAO allocated 225 ETH to buy a set of high-value and prestigious NFTs with the goal of establishing a collection that will drive value to DAO members and create interest in the DAO. In the collection are notable pieces from artists such as Nick Kuder, Justin Aversano, Snowfro, Refik Anadol, DCA, and Botto, among many others. Browse the full collection on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/hashesDAO).

The art is currently stored in a [multi-sig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x086E6Cfbb7D97d42E0e2A415a3E5674f0aCbD651) managed by five DAO members. These being the permutation sponsor, degenprincess, along with jenni, EBA, O_Gosh, and generalbarbie. The use of these harvested NFTs in the future includes the potential for fractional ownership for DAO members, museum exhibitions, and potentially selling them for a profit to replenish DAO funds.

### 2. Medleys

##### Sponsor: Kintsugi (Hash Hodler)

The second permutation funded the development of a generative art marketplace that expanded the utility of Hashes NFTs. This permissionless [marketplace](https://thehashes.xyz/medleys) is open for both artists and collectors to mint using a Hashes NFT, making it both accessible to a wide range of users whole also pushing value to the Hashes DAO. In this way, users can collect unique generative art created with the Hashes NFTs or in collaboration with the Hashes DAO, and have early access to future drops by OG generative artists, all while shaping the future of generative art.

In addition to building the marketplace, the Medleys permutation was also initiated with the premiere of the [Europa collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phOKE88y9Ks&t=2s&ab_channel=Kintsugi). This collaborative drop by [Joshua Davis](https://twitter.com/JoshuaDavis) and [Jana Stýblová](https://twitter.com/styblova) consisted of 30 unique animated and 60 still NFTs, with 10 aniamted mint allowlist slots being raffled to Hashes NFT holders.
