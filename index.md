# Hashes DAO

The Hashes is an NFT-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to push the boundaries of generative art and NFT infrastructure. The DAO has created open and permissionless tooling for generative artists to launch their collections. In addition, the DAO has sponsored initiatives called permutations to support up-and-coming artists and developers, as well as to reduce the technical barriers to creating an NFT collection.

As the Hashes continues to grow and evolve, we are always looking for talented artists, developers, and community members to join us and contribute to our open source projects. We welcome contributions from anyone and anywhere, and believe that collaborating with others helps to advance the art and infrastructure of the NFT space. If you're passionate about NFTs and generative art, we encourage you to get involved with the Hashes, and help to us shape the future of this exciting field.
