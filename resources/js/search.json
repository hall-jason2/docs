[[{"l":"Hashes DAO","p":["The Hashes is an NFT-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to push the boundaries of generative art and NFT infrastructure. The DAO has created open and permissionless tooling for generative artists to launch their collections. In addition, the DAO has sponsored initiatives called permutations to support up-and-coming artists and developers, as well as to reduce the technical barriers to creating an NFT collection.","As the Hashes continues to grow and evolve, we are always looking for talented artists, developers, and community members to join our team and contribute to our open source projects. We welcome contributions from anyone and anywhere, and believe that collaborating with others helps to advance the state of the art and infrastructure in the NFT space. If you're passionate about NFTs and generative art, we encourage you to get involved with the Hashes and help us shape the future of this exciting field."]},{"l":"Socials","p":["Twitter: Stay Informed","Discord: Pop in and say \"GM\"","Website: Mint and Explore","Opensea: Hashes NFT","GitHub: Git Clone"]}],[{"l":"Tokenomics","p":["At the heart of the Hashes DAO is the Hashes NFT, which conforms to the ERC721 NFT standard and has several simulatenous roles and functions within the organisation.","To begin with, the Hashes DAO utilizes a unique mechanism for minting its NFTs. Each NFT has an associated hash (hence the name!) and is minted using a specific phrase or message that is provided when minting. In practive this means that the hash associated with each NFT is deterministically generated when minting occurs. Specifically, users can mint a Hashes NFT by providing a phrase of their choice that is then hashed along with a monotonically increasing nonce (tokenId) and the minter's Ethereum address using the Keccak-256 hash function. This results in generating a unique 32-byte hash value for the token."]},{"l":"Types and Functions","p":["The Hashes NFT acts as the leading NFT of the ecosystem, a pseudo-random source of entropy for digital art, and a coordination mechanism for governance and on-chain operations. The Hashes NFT collection is divided into three categories: DAO Hashes, Standard Hashes, and Deactivated DAO Hashes:","DAO Hashes are the governance tokens of the DAO, and holders of these NFTs have the right to participate in the decision-making processes of the organization. Principally, DAO Hashes holders have the right to propose and vote on permutations, along with having shared ownership rights over the DAO's assets, namely the Permuation One NFTs. DAO Hashes holders also have exclusive access to community discord servers where operations and community initatives are discussed. When the DAO was founded in late 2021 the first 100 Hashes NFTs where reserved by Dex Labs, the primary founders of the DAO, with a subsequent 900 being made available to the public to mint for one Ether each. This was the initial capital raise of the DAO and a maximum of 1000 DAO hashes can exist.","Standard Hashes, on the other hand, do not convey governance rights and are mainly used as an entry point into the DAO allowing the community to expand organically. Standard Hashes are currently free to mint on Ethereum mainnet and can be used to mint hashes collections, such as Sigils Genesis, or in order to recieve discounts on purchases from the Trash Bin.","Lastly, Deactivated Hashes are former DAO Hashes that have had their governance rights revoked voluntarily by holders, and they now operate identically to standard hashes in the Hashes DAO ecosystem. Deactivated DAO hashes can be reactivated by holders who re-commit one Ether back to the DAO. At the time of writing there exist 15 Deactivated DAO hashes, meaning that the DAO is governed by 985 DAO Hashes."]}],[{"l":"Governance"}],[{"l":"Permutations","p":["Permutations in the Hashes DAO are are discrete and directed initiatives that the community funds and works together to undertake. Permutations can include things like artist or developer grants, where the DAO allocates funds to support specific projects or individuals. Alternatively, a permutation may be focused on building generative art infrastructure, which can entail both on and off-chain functionality. All permutations are proposed and voted on by the members of the DAO, and they should align with the overall ethos and mission of the collective.","During the proposal process of a permuation, a sponsor (typically the initial proposer) is elected to ensure the successful operation and fulfillment of the permuation. The sponsor acts as the project manager for the permutation, and is empowered to make permutation-specific executive decisions on behalf of the DAO. In this way, the sponsor can resolve routine challenges and decisions without requiring active participation by a quorum of DAO members. For instance, a sponsor is empowered to delegate, monitor, and remunerate constributors to a permutation. Sponsors are typically remunerated for their leadership role in the permutation also.","Thus far, six permutations have been initiated by the Hashes DAO, and they are as follows:"]},{"l":"1. The Harvest"},{"i":"sponsor-meltem-demirors-degenprincess","l":"Sponsor: Meltem Demirors (degenprincess)","p":["In the first permutation the DAO allocated 225 ETH to buy a set of high-value and prestigious NFTs with the goal of establishing a collection that will drive value to DAO members and create interest in the DAO. In the collection are notable pieces from artists such as Nick Kuder, Justin Aversano, Snowfro, Refik Anadol, DCA, and Botto, among many others. Browse the full collection on Opensea.","The art is currently stored in a multi-sig managed by five DAO members. These being the permutation sponsor, degenprincess, along with jenni, EBA, O_Gosh, and generalbarbie. The use of these harvested NFTs in the future includes the potential for fractional ownership for DAO members, museum exhibitions, and potentially selling them for a profit to replenish DAO funds.","Blossoming Cadaver - Botto"]},{"l":"2. Medleys"},{"i":"sponsor-kintsugi-hash-hodler","l":"Sponsor: Kintsugi (Hash Hodler)","p":["The second permutation funded the development of a generative art marketplace that expanded the utility of Hashes NFTs. This permissionless marketplace is open for both artists and collectors to mint using a Hashes NFT, making it both accessible to a wide range of users whole also pushing value to the Hashes DAO. In this way, users can collect unique generative art created with the Hashes NFTs or in collaboration with the Hashes DAO, and have early access to future drops by OG generative artists, all while shaping the future of generative art.","In addition to building the marketplace, the Medleys permutation was also initiated with the premiere of the Europa collection. This collaborative drop by Joshua Davis and Jana Stýblová consisted of 30 unique animated and 60 still NFTs, with 10 aniamted mint allowlist slots being raffled to Hashes NFT holders.","The Journey to Europa"]},{"l":"3. The Sigils"},{"i":"sponsor-deebee-thedavidb","l":"Sponsor: Deebee (thedavidb)","p":["Permutation three introduced the first dynamic and reputation-based NFTs into the Hashes ecosystem, as well as extending the DAO's infrastructure with the Sigil APIs and the Sigil management contract. Beginning with the Sigil Genesis NFTs, which are a collection of dynamic NFTs that change in appearance according to an owner's on-chain activity and contributions to the DAO. Activities such as buying, selling, or moving Hashes NFTs, as well as proposing or voting in DAO governance, will all modify the metadata of an owner's Sigil Genesis. In this way, a Sigil Genesis NFT can act as a source of reputation within the Hashes DAO. These Sigil Genesis NFTs are available to mint using a Hashes NFT.","Behind the scenes of the Sigil Genesis collection are the Sigil API endpoints and the Sigil Management contract. It is the Sigil API endpoints that are used to retreive data concerning the relevant on-chain activities of Sigil Genesis owners. This API is available for use by developers and artists looking for insight or inspiration into the Hashes ecosystem. Finally, the Sigil Management contract introduces a novel eligibility criteria for the set of all Sigil NFTs. The Sigil Genesis collection is so named because it is the first of several Sigil collections managed by the Sigil Management contract. This management contract ensures that a standard Hashes NFT can only be used to mint a single Sigil NFT (whether this be from the Genesis collection or otherwise), whereas a DAO Hashes NFT can be used to mint an NFT from each Sigil collection.","Artists interested in exploring these unique features are strongly encouraged to do so, and to reach out for more information on Discord.","Sigil Genesis #0"]},{"l":"4. The TrashBin"},{"i":"sponsor-θr","l":"Sponsor: Θr","p":["In permutation four the Hashes DAO tackled a fundamental issue with NFTs by building the JPEG Trash Bin. This core issue being that NFTs tend to be highly illiquid, with most having the unenviable position of possessing no active bids whatsoever. This poses a real problem for traders and investors looking to tax loss harvest at the end of the financial year, only to find that there are no counter-parties for their trades. The JPEG Trash Bin resolves this problem of terminal illiquidity by placing a permanent and implicit bid on every NFT on Ethereum.","The JPEG Trash Bin allows anyone to sell their illiquid NFTs on Ethereum to a smart contract in exchange for a small amount of ETH. Furthermore, this dApp also provides users with a marketplace where collectors can “dumpster dive” for NFT gems that others have previously trashed. Discounts on these re-purchases are available for standard (25% discount) and DAO (75% discount) Hash holders respectively. After an NFT is sold to the JPEG Trash Bin, it will be held for 20,000 blocks (roughly 3 days) to see if the DAO wishes to purchase it. After that holding period it will be open and available for anyone to purchase. Profits from the JPEG Trash Bin are divided between the builders and the Hashes DAO as an incentive alignment mechanism to promote further development and promotion.","JPEG Trash Bin"]},{"l":"5.
