[[{"l":"Hashes DAO","p":["The Hashes is an NFT-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to push the boundaries of generative art and NFT infrastructure. The DAO has created open and permissionless tooling for generative artists to launch their collections. In addition, the DAO has sponsored initiatives called permutations to support up-and-coming artists and developers, as well as to reduce the technical barriers to creating an NFT collection.","As the Hashes continues to grow and evolve, we are always looking for talented artists, developers, and community members to join our team and contribute to our open source projects. We welcome contributions from anyone and anywhere, and believe that collaborating with others helps to advance the state of the art and infrastructure in the NFT space. If you're passionate about NFTs and generative art, we encourage you to get involved with the Hashes and help us shape the future of this exciting field."]},{"l":"Socials","p":["Twitter: Stay Informed","Discord: Pop in and say \"GM\"","Website: Mint and Explore","Opensea: Hashes NFT","GitHub: Git Clone"]}],[{"l":"Tokenomics","p":["At the heart of the Hashes DAO is the Hashes NFT, which conforms to the ERC721 NFT standard and has several simulatenous roles and functions within the organisation.","To begin with, the Hashes DAO utilizes a unique mechanism for minting its NFTs. Each NFT has an associated hash (hence the name!) and is minted using a specific phrase or message that is provided when minting. In practive this means that the hash associated with each NFT is deterministically generated when minting occurs. Specifically, users can mint a Hashes NFT by providing a phrase of their choice that is then hashed along with a monotonically increasing nonce (tokenId) and the minter's Ethereum address using the Keccak-256 hash function. This results in generating a unique 32-byte hash value for the token."]},{"l":"Types and Functions","p":["The Hashes NFT acts as the leading NFT of the ecosystem, a pseudo-random source of entropy for digital art, and a coordination mechanism for governance and on-chain operations. The Hashes NFT collection is divided into three categories: DAO Hashes, Standard Hashes, and Deactivated DAO Hashes:","DAO Hashes are the governance tokens of the DAO, and holders of these NFTs have the right to participate in the decision-making processes of the organization. Principally, DAO Hashes holders have the right to propose and vote on permutations, along with having shared ownership rights over the DAO's assets, namely the Permuation One NFTs. DAO Hashes holders also have exclusive access to community discord servers where operations and community initatives are discussed. When the DAO was founded in late 2021 the first 100 Hashes NFTs where reserved by Dex Labs, the primary founders of the DAO, with a subsequent 900 being made available to the public to mint for one Ether each. This was the initial capital raise of the DAO and a maximum of 1000 DAO hashes can exist.","Standard Hashes, on the other hand, do not convey governance rights and are mainly used as an entry point into the DAO allowing the community to expand organically. Standard Hashes are currently free to mint on Ethereum mainnet and can be used to mint hashes collections, such as Sigils Genesis, or in order to recieve discounts on purchases from the Trash Bin.","Lastly, Deactivated Hashes are former DAO Hashes that have had their governance rights revoked voluntarily by holders, and they now operate identically to standard hashes in the Hashes DAO ecosystem. Deactivated DAO hashes can be reactivated by holders who re-commit one Ether back to the DAO. At the time of writing there exist 15 Deactivated DAO hashes, meaning that the DAO is governed by 985 DAO Hashes."]}],[{"l":"Governance"}],[{"l":"Permutations","p":["Permutations in the Hashes DAO are are discrete and directed initiatives that the community funds and works together to undertake. Permutations can include things like artist or developer grants, where the DAO allocates funds to support specific projects or individuals. Alternatively, a permutation may be focused on building generative art infrastructure, which can entail both on and off-chain functionality. All permutations are proposed and voted on by the members of the DAO, and they should align with the overall ethos and mission of the collective.","During the proposal process of a permuation, a sponsor (typically the initial proposer) is elected to ensure the successful operation and fulfillment of the permuation. The sponsor acts as the project manager for the permutation, and is empowered to make permutation-specific executive decisions on behalf of the DAO. In this way, the sponsor can resolve routine challenges and decisions without requiring active participation by a quorum of DAO members. For instance, a sponsor is empowered to delegate, monitor, and remunerate constributors to a permutation. Sponsors are typically remunerated for their leadership role in the permutation also.","Thus far, six permutations have been initiated by the Hashes DAO, and they are as follows:"]},{"l":"1.
